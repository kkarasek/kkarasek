# 👋 Hi, I’m Kuba 

#### I'm a self-taught frontend developer currently based in Warsaw, Poland 🇵🇱

- 👀 I’m interested in creating good looking, optimized and useful apps.
- 🛠 The tools I use are React, styled-components and Node to name a few.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Typescript with React and diving deep into framer-motion documentation. 
- 🎯 I also have Next.js and Vite in store for the following months.
- 💞 Personally I'm an athlete, avid record collector and synth-pop aficionado. 
- 📫 You can reach me at k_kaarasek@outlook.com or visit my ig [here](https://www.instagram.com/bette_davis_eyez/)
